# Top-Down Unity Sample Project

Welcome to the Storycraft Unity sample project!  
This template is a common starting point for an **unity developer coding interview**. 

Your mission: Extend the project by adding a _gun_ that lets the player shoot enemies—while demonstrating sound architecture, clean code, and thoughtful polish.

---

## ⚙️ Requirements

| **Unity** | **Unity 6 LTS** (any patch) |

> **Important:** The project will not open in older Unity 5.x or 2023 LTS versions—make sure Unity 6 LTS is installed and selected in the Hub before you begin.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone / download** this repository to your local machine.  
2. **Open** the project with **Unity 6 LTS** via Unity Hub.<br/>
   _First import may take a minute while packages re-compile._
3. Hit **Play** to verify:
   - ⬆/⬇/⬅/➡ or **WASD** moves the player character.  
   - Red “enemy blobs” roam randomly.

Everything else is up to you!

## 🎯 Interview Task

> **Add a functional, polished gun to the player.**

### Minimum Functional Requirements
- **Fire projectiles** toward the cursor / aim direction.
- **Damage & destroy** enemies on hit.
- **Follow camera** the camera follows the player as they move.

### Polish & Feel (choose what best showcases you)
- What kind of things do you want to add to make things feel juicy and good?

Good luck, and have fun building! We’re excited to see your craftsmanship ✨
